PRO, the Publishing Roles Ontology, is an ontology written in OWL 2 DL for the characterization of the roles of agents (people, corporate bodies and computational agents) in the publication process. It permits one to specify how an agent has a role relating to a contextual entity, and the period of time during which that role is held.
